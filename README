*** HOW TO USE ? ***

1 - Export your graph from Gephi as a GEXF file
2 - Replace "default.gexf" in the gexf-js directory by this file.

You can view more Gexf files by pointing your browser to index.html#Filename.gexf

*** COMPATIBILITY ***

Gexf-JS uses the canvas element, which might cause compatibility issues with older browsers.

It has been tested with the latest Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer versions.

It doesn't work with Internet Explorer 8 or older.

*** KNOWN ISSUES ***

You may have trouble using the viewer if you launch it from a local drive, as some browsers consider loading files from disk via Ajax to be unsecure.
It usually works with Firefox, but not with Chrome. In Internet Explorer you'll have a security pop-up asking you to "Allow blocked content".

Another solution is uploading it to a server, where it should work correctly.
